Python Program for Number of jump required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in 2D plane

CODE :

def minJumps(a, b, d): 

      

    temp = a 

    a = min(a, b) 

    b = max(temp, b) 

      

    if (d >= b): 

        return (d + b - 1) / b 

      

    

    if (d == 0): 

        return 0

   

    

    if (d == a): 

        return 1

   

    

    

    return 2

         


a = 3

b = 4

d = 11

print (int(minJumps(a, b, d)))
